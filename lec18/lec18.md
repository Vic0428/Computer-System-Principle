# Lecture 18: The interface of OS

## Introduction

1. The definition of interface

2. API

   Two kinds of OS interface

   - POSIX
   - Windows API (Win32) 

3. Implementation of APIs is the **lesser** problem

   - Performance can be improved later; bugs are irritating, but can be **fixed**

   API design is the **big** problem

   - Bugs
     - Developer misunderstood API
   - Performance
     - Transferring data (streaming or not?)
   - Many apps will be affected 
     - ABI: application binary interface
     - Change OS is hard

4. Why is API design a problem?

   - OS is a long term project and **hard to predict the future**
   - Want to extend one feature, old program will break!
     - Developer are unhappy!

5. Win32 API: From the view of software engineering

   Elements

   - More than 3000 functions, more than 1000 error codes

   - Clear API description => formal proof will make less bugs, and better API design (may improve performance)

   - VOID pointer can point to any type
   - Windows is a process of development. (From DOS). It canâ€™t even imagine the need of future. 
   - Windows use C language (pointer is flexible). Flexible, but high risks. 
     Type system problem may be the fault of C programming language.
