# 17. The Programming Language of OS

## Introduction

1. Some questions
   - Is Programming Language **important for OS**?
   - Is C **the best language of OS**?
   - Which parts of language affect OS deeply?
   - Other than languages, which components affect the development of OS?
   - Why do we need/needn’t to change the language for OS?
   - Other Langs(such as Rust, Go, etc.) based OS will be the future?

2. What is OS?

   - Focus on performance, reliability
   - Java is not a system programming language and Java is a general programming language.

   - C is both system programming language and **general programming language**
   - More focus on **performance**
